create a prompt file that specifies the creation of a pastebin-like web application with specific functional requirements and API routes.
Use Springboot and Java for the implementation. and React for the frontend.
Functional Requirements 
User capabilities 
1. Create a paste containing arbitrary text. 
2. Receive a shareable URL for that paste. 
3. Visit the URL to view the paste. 
4. Pastes may become unavailable based on optional constraints. 
Constraints on a Paste 
A paste may optionally include one or both of the following constraints: - - 
Time‑based expiry (TTL) 
View‑count limit 
Once a constraint is triggered, the paste becomes unavailable. 
If both constraints are present, the paste becomes unavailable as soon as either constraint triggers. 
Required Routes 
Health check 
GET /api/healthz - - - - 
Must return HTTP 200 
Must return JSON 
Must respond quickly 
Should reflect whether the application can access its persistence layer 
Example response: 
{ "ok": true } 
Create a paste 
POST /api/pastes 
Request body (JSON): 
{ 
} 
"content": "string", 
"ttl_seconds": 60, 
"max_views": 5 
Rules: - - - 
content is required and must be a non‑empty string 
ttl_seconds is optional; if present, it must be an integer ≥ 1 
max_views is optional; if present, it must be an integer ≥ 1 
Response (JSON, 2xx): 
{ 
} 
"id": "string", 
"url": "https://your-app.vercel.app/p/<id>" 
Error cases: - 
Invalid input must return a 4xx status with a JSON error body 
Fetch a paste (API) 
GET /api/pastes/:id 
Successful response (JSON, 200): 
{ 
} 
"content": "string", 
"remaining_views": 4, 
"expires_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" 
Notes: - - - 
remaining_views may be null if unlimited 
expires_at may be null if no TTL 
Each successful API fetch counts as a view 
Unavailable cases: - - - 
Missing paste 
Expired paste 
View limit exceeded 
All unavailable cases must return: - - 
HTTP 404 
JSON response 
View a paste (HTML) 
GET /p/:id - - 
Returns HTML (200) containing the paste content 
If the paste is unavailable, return HTTP 404 
Paste content must be rendered safely (no script execution). 
Deterministic Time for Testing 
Your application must support deterministic expiry testing. 
If the environment variable TEST_MODE=1 is set: 
- 
The request header 
x-test-now-ms: <milliseconds since epoch> 
must be treated as the current time for expiry logic only 
If the header is absent, use real system time. 
Persistence Requirement 
Automated tests run against your deployed application. 
If you deploy on a serverless platform (such as Vercel), in‑memory storage alone is usually insufficient. 
Use a persistence layer that survives across requests (KV/Redis/Postgres/etc), and document your 
choice. 
Automated Tests Your System Must Pass 
Our grader will run the following checks against your deployed URL: 
Service checks - - - 
/api/healthz returns HTTP 200 and valid JSON 
All API responses return valid JSON with correct Content‑Type 
Requests complete within a reasonable timeout 
Paste creation - - 
Creating a paste returns a valid id and url 
Returned URL points to /p/:id on your domain 
Paste retrieval - - 
Fetching an existing paste returns the original content 
Visiting /p/:id returns HTML containing the content 
View limits - - 
Paste with max_views = 1: - 
f
irst API fetch → 200 - 
second API fetch → 404 
Paste with max_views = 2: - 
two successful fetches - 
third fetch → 404 
Time‑to‑live (TTL) - - 
Paste with ttl_seconds is available before expiry 
After expiry (using x-test-now-ms), paste returns 404 
Combined constraints - 
Paste with both TTL and max views becomes unavailable when the first constraint triggers 
Error handling - - 
Invalid inputs return appropriate 4xx responses with JSON errors 
Unavailable pastes consistently return HTTP 404 
Robustness - - 
No negative remaining view counts 
No serving a paste beyond its constraints under small concurrent load 
UI Expectations (High‑Level) - - - 
Users can create a paste via the UI 
Users can view a paste via the shared link 
Errors (invalid input, expired paste) are shown clearly 
UI design and styling are not graded heavily, but the flows must work.
